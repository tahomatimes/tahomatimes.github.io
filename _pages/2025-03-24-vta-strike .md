As of writing this article, the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) has been on strike against VTA for exactly two weeks. The strike came after months of attempted negotiations between VTA and the ATU lead to an impasse. During this time, every single VTA service has ceased, including buses and the light rail.

Many people who have relied on VTA for transportation have arguably been the most negatively affected by the strike, as they now have to find another way to commute to work or to school. If you are reading this and are affected by the strike, continue reading to find some solutions!

If you have the means to do so, driving, biking, or walking to your destination is the easiest option for you. If you don’t live too far away from your place of work, taking a bicycle or going on foot should not be too much of a problem. If you have a car and your destination is farther away, that is an option, too.

However, if none of the prior options are of ease, calling an Uber or Lyft would be your next best option. In fact, this past week, shares of both Uber and Lyft have risen in the Bay Area due to more people using them instead of VTA. If using a rideshare takes too much time, or you can’t find one, contact someone you know who can drive you.

As of right now, however, VTA has sued the ATU for violating their terms of employment, claiming that they are not allowed to strike. VTA has also asked for Governor Newsom’s help in stopping the strike. Whatever happens, the strike is far from over, so it is suggested that frequent users of VTA services find another option for transportation.
