Now that it's December, the holiday season has officially arrived. Many people around the world celebrate different holidays based on their religion, culture, or other ideologies. Do you celebrate any of the following holidays?

## **Christmas - Dec 25, 2024**

Arguably the most popular seasonal holiday, Christmas, is the celebration of Jesus Christ’s birth, the central figure in the Christian faith. Christmas is typically celebrated by giving gifts to one another, decorating a pine tree, and having a feast with loved ones.

## **Hanukkah - Dec 25, 2024 to Jan 2, 2025**

Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday commemorating a religious miracle, in which a small group reclaimed a Holy Temple by lighting a menorah with only a day’s worth of oil to keep it aflame. However, the menorah would stay lit for eight days, corresponding to the eight days that Hanukkah is celebrated. It is celebrated through feasts, games, and, of course, lighting a menorah.

## **Kwanzaa - Dec 26, 2024 to Jan 1, 2025**

A relatively new holiday, only being introduced in 1966, Kwanzaa is a cultural holiday that is mostly celebrated by African Americans. The holiday values unity, self-determination, faith, and other commutative values. Like Hanukkah, a candle is lit every night in a special candle holder called a kinara.

## **St. Lucy’s Day - Dec 13, 2024**

Mostly celebrated in Sweden, St. Lucy’s Day is another Christian holiday commemorating Lucy of Syracuse, a virgin martyr who brought food and other forms of aid to Christians hiding from the Romans. She wore a special wreath with candles on her head to see at night and to keep her hands free.

## **New Year’s Day - Jan 1, 2025**

New Year’s Day can be celebrated by almost anyone, regardless of religion or culture. It celebrates the transition from an old year into a new one, per the Gregorian calendar. People often stay up until midnight to welcome the new year by counting down and releasing fireworks. People also make resolutions to mold themselves into better human beings.

Overall, many people around the world have different ways of celebrating the holidays, so until then, happy holidays and a happy new year!
