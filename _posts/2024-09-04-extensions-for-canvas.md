Hey Tahoma!

As students are adjusting to the new platform, there have been many improvements from the previous Summit Learning Platform. But, there are also new challenges that come with this change.Â  Fortunately, there are extra tools that can assist us in organizing courses, assignments, and making Canvas more customizable and user-friendly. Here are some that can help enhance the overall experience!

## **BetterCanvas**

BetterCanvas is an extension that improves your platform in a variety of ways such as

*   Enabling dark mode
*   Improving due dates
*   Customizing course names
*   Using different themes

## **Tasks For Canvas**

Tasks For Canvas is another extension that is geared towards academic organization.

*   Provides a convenient to-do list of your weekly assignments
*   Gives you updates and reminders about assignment due dates
*   Provides a more visual representation of your grades

## **Canvas+**

Canvas+ is like both BetterCanvas and Tasks For Canvas combined. Canvas+ can

*   Change sidebar colors
*   Customize dashboard themes
*   Improve email reading
*   Improve reloading pages and scrolling

These Canvas extensions can hopefully make the shift from the Summit Learning Platform to Canvas easier, smoother, and maybe even more fun!
