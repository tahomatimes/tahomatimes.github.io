On Thursday, US President Joe Biden delivered his annual State of the Union address, discussing issues including abortion rights, the war in Israel, and concerns about his age.

Biden was uncharacteristically energetic, proving that he still has the energy left in him to lead our country. He also discussed Laken Riley, the college student who was killed by an immigrant, saying, “We can fight about fixing the border or we can fix it.”

Donald Trump is expected to run against Biden in the presidential election later this year.
