You may have seen signs on major highways in the US using clever and funny ways to get the public to be more careful on the road. But the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has said that they are too distracting.

The ban will go into effect starting in 2026, as the FHWA has stated that “Messages with… popular culture references… or that are intended to be humorous should not be used.”

The public disagrees with this decision, believing that the humor exhibited in these signs could prevent road rage. However, the FHWA has insisted that they must go.

The highway sign rule is only one of 1,100 pages worth of new road rules released in a new manual by the FHWA this year.
