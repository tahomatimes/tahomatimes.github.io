Santos was a controversial figure in his run for congressman, as he had openly admitted to lying on his resume and lying about his credentials. His downfall began a few weeks ago when evidence of him illegally spending his campaign funds on Botox and other items was released. Santos left the Capitol building before the vote was confirmed, saying “To hell with this place!” on the way out.

Santos, the first openly gay republican congressman, was known for his lies. An election for a new republican congress member representing New York will occur soon.
