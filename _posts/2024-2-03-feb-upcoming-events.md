Hey Tahoma! We have a bit going on in the next two months, so let's recap…

## Spirit Week

Spirit Week will be taking place in February; below are the days.

**Monday 2/12:** Cartoon Day (dress in a way that represents a cartoon or cartoon character)

**Tuesday 2/13:** BBQ Dad vs Soccer Mom (open to interpretation, I suppose)

**Wednesday 2/14:** On Wednesdays We Wear Pink (it'll be Valentine's Day - wear pink for spirit!!)

**Thursday 2/15:** Throwback Thursday (wear an outfit from the 80s, 90s, etc.)

**Friday 2/16:** Plush & Pajama Day (certified Tahoma classic)

The mentor group with the highest Spirit Week participation will receive their trophy after the winners have been determined.
