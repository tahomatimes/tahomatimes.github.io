At the Tahoma Times, our dedication is to provide high school journalism that is
trustworthy, transparent, and empowers our student community. We hold ourselves
accountable to ethical practices, ensuring our reporting fosters accuracy, fairness, and
quality in every story.

These principles serve as the compass for our journalistic endeavors, guiding our decisions
on a day-to-day basis. While they may not cover every ethical dilemma we encounter, they
form the core values upon which our student newspaper operates.

# Accuracy and Fairness
Accuracy and fairness are the keystones of journalism. Ensuring the correct presentation
of facts within the proper context is paramount. Additionally, fairness is integral to our
coverage. We approach each story with an open mind, making sincere efforts to include all
relevant facts and perspectives.

# Sourcing
In our pursuit of accuracy and transparency, we aim to verify information to the best of
our ability. We cite all of our sources at the end of each article to inspire the reader to
conduct their own research and come to their own conclusions.

# Corrections Policies
Should we discover flaws or misleading aspects in our reporting, we shall promptly take
corrective action and openly acknowledge the error to our student audience. Addressing
and rectifying our mistakes is crucial in maintaining our integrity (you can contact us with
revisions through our contact form at the top of our website).

# Digital Content Removal Policy
Our approach to content removal on digital platforms is considered on a case-by-case
basis. If a reader provides evidence of a change in circumstances, we will assess the
possibility of removing the story.

_Our vow to Ethical Journalism above is heavily inspired by the standards for publishing as
described by the NBC Bay Area News [here](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/nbc-bay-area-news-standards-and-publishing-principles/3216064/)._
