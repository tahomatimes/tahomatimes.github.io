# Who am I? 

I'm Achintya, a recent transfer from Summit Denali, who has many plans
to ensure that we have an exhilarating year. Throughout my high school
years, I've accumulated leadership experience through volunteering,
chess, personal endevoars, and more. In these roles, I've had to plan,
organize, and prepare activities and lessons for these activities.
Through these experiences, I've gained insight on what works and what
doesn't. Beyond my insight, I go above and beyond in all of my work as
it is vital that I perform to the best of my ability. In the student
council, I will apply what I've learned in order to coordinate and
create great events for all.

# Why should you vote for me? 

Your vote is powerful. It should reflect what you want out of this
school year which is exactly why you should vote for me. For starters,
I've acquired leadership experiences over these past 3 years that have
allowed me to understand what it takes to be a great leader. In my
experience, there are three main aspects that create a great leader:
communication, experience, and ideas. Now, you might be wondering "How
do I demonstrate these skills?". Well, I've gained communications skills
through my years of running clubs and going to extra-curriculars as I've
been forced to communicate and coordinate with others. For instance,
I've had to coordinate events for Chess club and Volunteering club which
has led me to understanding how to meet everyone's needs. Now, as I've
mentioned, I've had numerous experiences that have helped me, however, I
haven't mentioned how they've helped me develop the skills necessary for
Secretary. Beyond my leadership, I've gained note-taking skills by
taking over 10 AP classes and other collegiate-level courses. In these
classes, I've had to take detailed notes to study mid-terms and finals.
These skills will prove to be crucial in student council as I must write
detailed notes for every meeting and event. I've mentioned what makes me
qualified to run for secretary, however, you should hear a few of my
ideas. To start, I would like to have a few classics:

-   The carnival

-   The winter dance

-   Prom

-   Movie night

-   Student-faculty events

    -   Sports day

    -   Obstacle Course

    -   Hide-n-seek

Throughout the school year, I would like to add to this list and improve
upon these ideas to ensure we have a GREAT school year. Make the right
choice. Vote Achintya for Secretary.
