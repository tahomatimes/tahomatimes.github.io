Thousands of houses and other institutions lost power, including Summit Tahoma. The storm caused our camps to shut down and host virtual classes for two days, with one day off from all educational activities. The school reopened on Thursday, resuming all classes normally. As of writing this article, PG&E reports that almost 10,000 people are without power.

The official classification of the storm is a “bomb cyclone,” which is a storm where the average pressure dropped significantly in a 24-hour time span. The fastest gusts of wind were recorded in Marin County at a fast 102 mph, the same speed as a Category 2 hurricane.
