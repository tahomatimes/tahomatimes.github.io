Ebrahim Raisi, the president of Iran, was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. He was 63 years old.

Raisi, a key conspirator in the 1988 murder of 5,000 political prisoners, was elected in 2021, and even though he had a short time in office, his regime will lead a lasting effect on Iran’s government.

Raisi was not elected to office in the sense that he had political skill, rather that he simply had the qualities to be a key member in Iran’s theocracy, as well as a highly orchestrated election.

Mohammad Mokhber, Iran’s acting president, has already taken over.
