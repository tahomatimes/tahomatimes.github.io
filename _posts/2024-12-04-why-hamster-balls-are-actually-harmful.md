If you have ever owned a little hamster or just heard of their care, then you have definitely heard of the super popular hamster ball. The hollow plastic balls are used as a tool for exercise and entertainment for your hamster. You can find them in numerous pet shops all over the world. But many incidents of injury and distress lead us to question: are hamster balls really as good as they claim they are?

But if not hamster balls, how will we give our furry friends the proper enrichment they deserve? Fret not! There are numerous other ways to give them just that without the fear of stress and injury.

Hamster balls are some of the most popular exercise tools in the pet circle: they’re simple, found in many places, and people may think they seem like a good way to keep your little buddy entertained. But this belief, unfortunately, couldn’t be further from the truth. Many vets and hamster experts say that, in many cases, hamster balls are rather detrimental to a hamster’s health and well-being.

First off, the balls are enclosed and unfamiliar. Having your hamster in there for a prolonged amount of time is deeply stressful for them since hamster balls can offer little control and poor visibility. Breathing isn’t always easy, and even if you use larger balls, like those made for rats, their larger breathing holes could easily trap and injure your hamster, not to mention that they are constantly rolling, which can exhaust and hurt them further.


People often don’t consider these facts when giving their furry friend some free yet controlled time to roam since hamsters don’t show direct signs of distress when tumbling about, and they also look cute while they do so. Though you may not notice, I would still urge you to find better options so as not to put your tiny pal in danger.

## What Should You Do Instead?

Well, it’s surprisingly simple. You can open a clean spatial room in your home or make a large enclosed section for your pet to roam, putting toys and treats to spruce up their time even more. Or, if you have one, play with them in an empty bathtub or even a kiddy pool! It is good enrichment exercise and can help you to bond with your hamster in a more connected and closer way. Plus, there’s the added bonus of not needing to buy much. You can DIY hamster toys using stuff you already have, like empty boxes, empty paper towels/toilet paper tubes, cardboard, and string. All that’s left to do is get creative! Tap into your pet engineer and keep your hamster happy, healthy, and having a blast!
