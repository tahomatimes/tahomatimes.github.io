According to the Office of Population Affairs, almost 50% of teens in the U.S. struggle with mental health problems, and an even higher amount of teen students (77%). The American Physiological Association states that more than 20% of teens have “seriously considered suicide,” and teens who are minorities or members of the LGBTQ+ community are even higher: 2.5 times higher for minority teens and 4 times as likely for an LGBTQ+ teen. This issue is exacerbated because at least half of American families cannot afford access to Mental Services. California has started a mission to bring free mental services to all California Teens through its CalHope program. This program offers free online mental services, like counseling, through its two mobile apps, BrightLife Kids and Soluna. This article will highlight the two apps, what they are, and how to access them. 

## Soluna

Soluna is an app on both the Apple and Google Play stores. This app offers mental health services via counseling with trained professionals for Californians between the ages of thirteen and twenty-five. The app requires no personal information except a ZIP code to ensure your residency in California. Counseling consists of a text-based chat where you message with mental health-trained professionals. You don't tell them your name, and if you decide to work with one, all your information is confidential and is protected between you and your counselor under the law, meaning they cannot share anything you tell them unless you state you are going to harm yourself or others. The app also offers readings and other resources about how others can struggle with the same issue you are facing. Most importantly, the app is entirely free. 

## BrightLife Kids

BrightLife Kids can be accessed through CalHope's official website and offers mental services for new parents as well as children from as young as toddlers to twelve years old. They can give resources to young parents who are struggling to help them learn how to be the best version of themselves. For younger kids, this site promotes balancing alone time with family time, developing healthy eating and emotion management, and teaching how to express yourself. 

With the largest epidemic worldwide being mental health struggles, having a massive impact on teens specifically, this app offers hope and support for all teens in California that is 100% confidential and 100% free.  

## Why it Matters

Initiatives like Soluna and BrightLife Kids from California's CalHope program offer vital support to address the escalating mental health challenges among teenagers. With nearly half of U.S. teens struggling with mental health issues and alarming rates of suicidal ideation, these accessible and confidential services provide essential resources and counseling for young Californians, ensuring a brighter, healthier future for generations to come.
