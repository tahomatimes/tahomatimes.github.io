The hacking of his phone, which took place for nearly a decade in between 2003 and 2011, reportedly caused paranoia and caused his relationship with Chelsy Davy to be broken down.

Piers Morgan, editor of the Daily Mirror, denied the court claims, stating that he has “never hacked a phone, or told anybody else to hack a phone, and nobody has produced any actual evidence to prove that I did.”
