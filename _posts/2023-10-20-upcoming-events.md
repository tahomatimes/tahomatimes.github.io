Many exciting events are coming up at Tahoma! Here is a quick overview of what to expect in these coming weeks.


## Movie Night
Student Council has organized the next fall event: a Halloween Movie Night! On October 20th, there will be 4 different movies playing in various classrooms from 6 to 9 p.m. Bring some cash to buy concessions like popcorn or pizza at the event. Though the exact movies have yet to be decided, you can vote for your favorite ones at [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvGTK7mONvk3xm2un0zbTJjxD9vnaW-DhiJ-bsD9Ku61XdeA/viewform). 

## Expeditions
Our first round of expeditions starts the following Monday, the 23rd. For two weeks, you’ll be attending your elective classes, and, if you're caught up on school work, no work for any of your core classes! Be sure to check your email to see which expedition experiences you’ve been placed into. If you’d like to change your expedition, fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/bj3M9a7LLfu1Ff7z5). Remember to bring any waivers you might need to your expedition classes, or you might not be able to participate. 

## Winter Dance
Student Council just announced a Winter Dance for all grades. The dance is set for December 2nd and is going to be held at a venue outside of school. Though prices have yet to be determined, you can fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OJbW1vS5G85JMoCtzEl8pb0akfaNuQDUeFPJgWWK7oU/edit?ts=6531aac3) to choose what price you are willing to pay to attend. The location and the time of the dance are yet to be announced, but ticket sales will start sometime after expeditions.
