Tomorrow is Super Tuesday, meaning in 15 states, the primary election will be held for President, Congress, State Assembly, and Senate. Unlike the November elections that decide who will be in office, a primary election decides who is most likely to win their race. Every vote cast for this primary here in California will decide who will get the nomination for each party race to run against each other in November, except for the Senate race. The Senate has 2 spaces on this primary ballot: one for the candidate's electability and one to replace Lephonza Butler, the interim Senator holding the late Dianne Feinstein's seat until November. It's important to note that the candidate who will hold Butler's seat will most likely also be elected in November. By voting in this primary, you will be able to use your democratic right to decide who you want to see running in November. 

## How can you vote?

First, you must be at least 18 and registered to vote in California, but you can pre-register by getting a driver's license at 16. [Here is a link](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/same-day-reg) to information on same-day registration if you're over the age of 18. Even if you cannot vote in this election, you can still influence it by pushing relatives, friends, or family members to vote. Remember, you can only vote in the primary for the party you are registered with. 

## Who are the candidates?

### President

For the Democratic party, Incumbent Joe Biden is running for a second term. Some of his campaign propositions include protecting reproductive freedoms and LGBTQ+ rights, finishing what he started in 2020, and his key message of “a battle for the soul of democracy over autocracy,” which includes keeping Former President Trump out of office. He has two opponents: Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who is running on the idea that we need a younger generation to lead the country, and Marianne Williamson, an author and former spiritual advisor to Oprah who recently restarted her campaign after suspending it when she received 2% of the vote in the Iowa Caucus.

For the Republican party, former President Donald Trump is running for reelection after being defeated by Joe Biden in 2020. He is running on the proposition of shutting down the southern border and has hinted at nationwide 6-week abortion bans. His key message is to “Make America great again” and that Biden is “losing it.” In recent years, Donald Trump has had more polarizing ideas than his counterparts, including but not limited to the view that the Justice System is rigged against him, as he's facing 91 criminal charges, and that the 2020 election was stolen from him by Joe Biden. Trump's opponent is former South Carolina Governor and former United States Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley. Haley is running on many of the same propositions as Donald Trump but has more moderate ideas on abortion rights. Haley states she is a better candidate than Trump because of his vendetta against Joe Biden and his divisiveness, as well as his age and her repeated attacks on his and Biden's mental and cognitive stability.

### Senate

There are currently four candidates for the California Senate seat to replace the late Dianne Feinstein after she died in 2023. These four candidates are House Democrats Representative Adam Schiff, Representative Katie Porter, Representative Barbara Lee, and Former Dodger player Steve Garvey. Schiff is running on his well-known persona of taking on Donald Trump in the January 6th Committee, where he investigated alleged crimes of the former president causing an insurrection, as well as the idea that democrats need to caucus with him to beat Steve Garvey, who voted for the former president twice. Katie Porter is running on her persona of taking on big business, lowering prescription drug costs, and fighting for the average American. She has also been on the offense by attacking her opponents, stating that she hasn't taken money from Super-PACS or large corporations as the other candidates have. Barbara Lee is running on her longtime service and outspoken activism for peace compared to the other candidates. She has been the only candidate to call for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and has noted that she was the sole representative in Congress who voted against invading Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. Steve Garvey, the only Republican in the race, has gained recent traction in polls the past week. He is running on solving crime and immigration. He has stated that he's a more moderate Republican but has refused to comment if he will vote for Trump in November. The second Senate seat for California is more than likely to be promised to Alex Padilla, the incumbent. 

### House of Representatives

Incumbents representing portions of San Jose, Ro Khanna, Jimmy Panetta, and Zoe Lofgren, are expected to win their elections. Up for grabs is current representative Anna Eshoo's seat that stretches from Pacifica down to Lexington Hills. Major cities it represents include Mountain View, Saratoga, Los Gatos, Campbell, and Portions of San Jose, including Willow Glen and West San Jose. The front runner is Former San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, who is running on his experience in the region and his time as the leader of the largest city in the Bay Area. Some of his opponents include Joe Simitian, the current Santa Clara County Supervisor, and Evan Low, who is in the State Assembly. 

### State Assembly and State Senate

Arguably more significant as they have more effect on you, the State Senate and the Assembly primaries will also occur tomorrow. Both chambers of government for California have several races that you could be a part of depending on the districts you are in, which are remarkably smaller than that of the U.S. House districts. Use [this link](https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/) to find your representative in the State Senate and Assembly to see their propositions and ideas. 

### Propositions 

One proposition is on the ballot tomorrow, which is the final vote for the proposition, and will not get another vote in November. This proposition, which is unique in the way that both Republicans and Democrats have endorsed it, will strengthen mental health support by creating more health treatment centers and residential units.  The prop will also support California veterans who are at risk of homelessness by offering them support through counseling and other social services. The proposition will dictate how much of the state budget can be used to combat substance abuse and other disorders. 

## Why should you vote?

This election is the first stage in exercising the most democratic freedom you have: the right to vote and choose your representatives. While some background information is given, you should also commit your research on candidates and propositions. In this era of partisan politics that has taken hold of our government, it is more important than ever to elect the best leader for you and your community. This is your first step in using your voice to push a rhetoric that will do what the government is supposed to do: provide for you and aid you in your woes. 

## How do you make your voice heard if you can't vote?

The High School Democrats of America (HSDA) has the mission of giving a voice to younger members of society who cannot express themselves through vote. It is a program and membership that connects politically inclined persons to join together for a greater cause. Use [this link](https://hsdems.org/) to sign up and find resources on the policies of the group and how to join a local chapter.
