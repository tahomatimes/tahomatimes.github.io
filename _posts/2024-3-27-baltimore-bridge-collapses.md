In the wee hours of Monday, a massive cargo ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland, causing it to collapse.

Eight construction workers were on the bridge when it collapsed. Two were rescued, but the rest have yet to be found.

The Sri Lanka bound ship, the MV Dali, lost power for about thirty seconds before it turned back on. By then, it was too late to prevent the disaster. The ship issued a mayday call, allowing cops to prevent more vehicles from crossing the bridge and, in the process, potentially saving lives.
