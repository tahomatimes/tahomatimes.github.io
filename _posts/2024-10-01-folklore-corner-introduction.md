Looking at the title of this article, nobody could blame you for wondering what it’s doing in a school newspaper of all places. The answer, simply put, is that the headlines these days are full of stress and current events. In a world where the majority of news is about heartbreaking situations and politics, it pays to be able to take a step back and dive into something that’s wholly disconnected from the din that surrounds us.

Folklore and mythology have been staples of human culture ever since we as a species first began. We are wired with fear and wonder at the unknown, and that has led us to tell stories of all kinds about what we think is lurking out there just beyond what we can see. Tragically, as humans turn our eyes more and more to technology, we’ve started to completely lose contact with the legends etched into the world around us by our ancestors. Regarded now as nothing more than ridiculous stories, folklore no longer holds the same valuable cultural significance as it once did. This section of the Tahoma Times aims to restore some of that old connection.

Whether or not you believe in these creatures and the tales surrounding them is entirely up to you. However, the fact remains that what will be covered here once held – and may still hold – significance to someone in the world. From covering mythological creatures such as harpies and dragons to delving into information about cryptids such as the Jersey Devil and Bigfoot, Folklore Corner aims to respectfully discuss and educate people on urban legends, tall tales, old superstitions, and everything in between.

Come, gather close to the firelight and read carefully. Perhaps one day, these whispers of the unknown will form some kind of meaning to you, too. And whatever you believe: stay safe out there.
