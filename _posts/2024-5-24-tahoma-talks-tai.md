While only here for a short stint, subs still receive a useful and sometimes more authentic view of the state of students learning. Mr. Tai, the substitute teacher for Mr. Choi’s Modern World II class, is no different. For weeks, Mr Tai watched the students of Modern World II and, while teaching, saw the ups and downs of learning, the struggles of students, and their perseverance. Applying his life lessons, he encourages students to push the boundaries of their work ethic, only helping to motivate those around him. 

## What did you do before becoming a substitute teacher? 

“I worked in the biotech industry for ten years doing DNA sequencing. After retiring, I opened a few dry cleaning businesses and a finance business that my wife helped with.”

## Why did you decide to become a substitute teacher?

“I became a sub due to a coincidence. I was semi-retired, only helping to run my business, and I became bored. My sister, who teaches high school in East San Jose, told me that I could become a substitute teacher quite quickly so I decided to get my credentials. I liked the idea because it was flexible to my schedule. I have subbed for grades from kindergarten to high school.”

## What do you like most about Summit?

“I like the Platform the most, especially the content assessments, additionals, PFAs, and projects. The technology available to students nowadays really enables them to get good resources and learn.”

## What do you think could change Summit for the better? 

“I wish the checkpoints had some weight to them. If they had some meaning or a grade students would pay more attention to the content which would help them in the long run. I see many students skip the checkpoints, jump to the final product, and then struggle to finish it.” 

## While subbing for high school, what do you notice students struggle with the most?

“Procrastination. I notice that many struggle with self-discipline and have a low inner drive to complete their work.”

## What did you struggle with the most in your education? 

“In high school, I didn’t give it my best and I didn’t try. I procrastinated and put off my work, leading me to struggle. I had a lack of motivation since I had nobody to look up to or push me. I grew up without a father and my mother was working long hours so I was alone to push myself to do work and I didn’t. That is why I pushed other students too much to do their work because nobody was there to push me and It had a huge impact on my learning, especially the procrastination. It follows you to college when you set in your ways, I dropped out twice and started working, and only on the third time did I end up graduating with my bachelor's. This is why it's vital to try and get in the habit of doing work on time because it will haunt you in the future. This is why I teach because I want to teach kids not to repeat my mistakes. When you're younger, you don't think about it, but it's a big chunk of your life, ten years that I feel like I threw away.” 

## What advice would you give to students?

“Just don't procrastinate, do your work. Besides that, I would also recommend trying to try and invest. For gifts to my kids, I would give them money to buy stock. It helps, especially in this economy, to be able to make money while you're sleeping. Save that money and pay for college so you don't have to work for the rest of your life.” 

## What can we learn from Mr. Tai?

Today will be Mr. Tai’s last day, and I appreciate his dedication to teaching during these last few weeks. Through his first-hand experience of troubled education, Mr Tai carries a burden that he urges other students not to follow. His passion for teaching stems from his lack of motivation and desire to be the motivator for us. He knows the hardships that procrastination causes, and he is on top of students not to follow in his footsteps. In his preaching of doing work on time, his pursuit of caring for our futures shines bright.
