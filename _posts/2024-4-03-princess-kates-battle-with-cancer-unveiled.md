Last week, in a stunning turn of events, Princess Kate of Wales announced to the world that she has cancer. She is 42 years old.

Ever since her abdominal surgery earlier this year, the royal stayed curiously quiet in the months that followed. Speculation arose about the health of the princess, and now everyoneâ€™s questions have been answered. She revealed in the video that her surgery was successful, but later tests after the surgery revealed she had cancer.
