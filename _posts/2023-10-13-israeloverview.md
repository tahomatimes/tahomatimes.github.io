Last weekend, the Hamas government of Palestine launched a surprise attack on Israel, taking innocent people hostage and launching airstrikes on major Israeli cities. Hundreds of people were taken hostage, and are yet to be recovered.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, has stated that Israel is at war with Palestine, and plans a large retaliation. This retaliation has only started, however, as he has said this is only the beginning.

This conflict has meant losses to both sides, and this skirmish seems to be far from over. The only thing we can do now is hope that this doesnâ€™t last any longer than we expect and an agreement will be met.
