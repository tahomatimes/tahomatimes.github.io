The 2024 Expeditions Fair was a huge success! Let’s take a look back at the event, and look forward to the upcoming expeditions for this year.

This year, students had choices ranging from ceramics to creative theater, with a little bit of everything in between. Older students also had the opportunity to take an internship or a passion project in a specific subject they were interested in.

Old favorites such as Cooking and Art are returning for this year, as are some new courses on the scene, like MMA/Self Defense. There are also several new camp counselor opportunities, with the YMCA at Camp Campbell and the Santa Cruz County Outdoor Science School joining the roster.

The Expeditions Survey is due on Monday, so fill it out if you haven’t already. Remember, the first round begins on October 21st!
