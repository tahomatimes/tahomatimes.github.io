In 2022, 65 San José citizens lost their lives on small, local roads due to speeding vehicles. Bill AB-645 aims to lower this number for the future.

### Background

The streets around town often have their speed limits clearly posted, but for one reason or another—be it wide roads, careless drivers, or peer pressure—, those speed limits are disregarded. In residential and school zones especially, this can lead to fatal outcomes. I'm sure you have noticed many cars speeding down Eagles Lane or Blossom Hill Road. It's only a matter of time before a student's life may be put at risk because of a reckless driver.

### Bill AB-645

This bill, which was approved by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Oct. 13, 2023, authorizes several Californian cities to “establish a Speed Safety System Pilot Program”. In short, it provides cities with the resources necessary to pilot the installation of speed cameras near schools and high-risk roads.

### Speed Cameras

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, speed cameras lead to a 20 to 35 percent reduction in vehicular crashes leading to injury. Other options—such as stationing police—may not lead to the impartial reduction of speed. Speed cameras are impartial and don't require a 24/7 police presence. But before Oct. 13, they were not legal in California.

### Significance

Bill AB-645 approves a _trial_ program for cities in California. Advocates have been calling for the installation of speed cameras for years, and now their efforts have come to fruition. Only time will tell if they will truly make our streets safer for students and residents.
